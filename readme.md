# Star Citizen Dogfighting Simulator


Test your loadouts with a physics based dogfighting simulation that takes into account weapon spread, recharge times, ship size and speeds, and power management settings.

Once you've created an account, you will be able to create loadouts based on current game data and test them against common loadouts in pvp, or against other custom loadouts you've created. (In progress)

Currently, the algorithm is only available through tests! Web interface is still in progress.
